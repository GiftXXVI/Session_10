				# Containers
				- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the
				application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
				- Containers images are lightweight, standalone and they include everything needed to run an
				application: code,
				runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
				- Container images become containers at runtime.
				- Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences
				for instance between development and staging.
