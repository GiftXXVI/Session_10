					## 🗄 Containers
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What is a Container?
					- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the
					application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Container Images
					- Containers images are lightweight, standalone and they include everything needed to run an
					application: code,
					runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
					- Container images become containers at runtime.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Why do we use Containers?
					- Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite
					differences for instance between development and staging.

					## 🚢 Docker
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What is Docker?
					- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
					- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a container.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Docker Engine (CLI)
					- Docker Engine acts as a client-server application for building containers that can be accessed
					from the Terminal.
					- It has the following components:
					- dockerd: a server with a long-running daemon process.
					- APIs: specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
					- docker: A command line interface (CLI) client.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Docker Destop (GUI)
					- Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
					- It includes the Docker Engine.
					- It is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux (deb package for Debian/Ubuntu and rpm package for
					Fedora/Red Hat).
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Docker Playground (Online)
					- You can also use the Docker Playground to learn Docker in an online environment.
					- You can also use you Terminal to ssh into the Playground VM.
					- URL: [🔗 Docker Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)

					## 💿 Docker Images
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What is a Docker Image
					- An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
					- It usually consists of a file system with files and packages necessary to run your applications.
					- Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Example Recipe
					1. start with the Python3 image, install Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy (and other requirements)
					2. copy your source code files
					3. define a program to run (such as gunicorn or waitress web servers)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### ... From Images, To Containers
					- From there you are able to create containers from your image.
					- A container is a runnable instance of an image.
					- A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when
					you create or start it.

					## 🎫 Docker Hub
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What is Docker Hub?
					- Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images.
					- It is the world’s largest repository of container images.
					- You can create public repositories for free or choose a subscription plan for private
					repositories.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Features of Docker Hub
					| Feature | Description |
					|---|---|
					| Repositories | Push and pull container images. |
					| Teams & Organizations | Manage access to private repositories of container images. |
					| Docker Official Images | Pull and use high-quality container images provided by Docker. |
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Features of Docker Hub
					| Feature | Description |
					|---|---|
					| Docker Verified Publisher Images | Pull and use high- quality container images provided by external vendors. |
					| Builds | Automatically build container images from GitHub and Bitbucket and push them to Docker Hub. |
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Features of Docker Hub
					| Feature | Description |
					|---|---|

					## 🗃 Dockerfiles
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What are Dockerfiles?
					- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.
					- Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile.
					- A docker image consists of read-only layers of which each represents a Dockerfile instruction.
					- Each instruction / command in a Dockerfile creates one layer.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Dockerfile Instructions
					- **FROM** defines a base image , ( creates a layer from the specified  Docker image.)
					- **COPY** used to copy local files / directories to Docker Container.
					- **ADD** allows you to copy from a URL source.
					- **RUN**  executes command in a new image layer. (We can have multiple RUN  commands).
					- **ENTRYPOINT**  defines a container’s executable.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Dockerfile Instructions
					- **WORKDIR** defines the work directory for subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile.
					- **CMD** specifies what command to run within the container.
					- **EXPOSE** documents which ports are exposed(Only used for documentation)
					- **ENV** instruction sets the environment variable
					- **VOLUME** creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### What is a .dockerignore file?
					- Similar to a .gitignore file used by git, a docker ignore file is a tool that can help you define the Docker build context you need.
					- You can use it to exclude files and folders from the build context.
					- This helps to avoid unnecessarily sending large or sensitive files and directories to the daemon and potentially adding them to images using **ADD**  or  **COPY .**
				</section>
				<section data-markdown data-background-image="images/circle-scatter-haikei.svg">
					### Sample
					```Dockerfile
					FROM python:stretch

					RUN mkdir /app
					COPY . /app
					WORKDIR /app

					RUN apt update
					RUN apt install python3-pip -y
					RUN pip install --upgrade pip
					RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

					ENTRYPOINT [ "gunicorn","-b",":8080","api:app" ]
					```
