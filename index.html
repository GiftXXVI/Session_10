					## Containers
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### What is a Container?
					- A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the
					application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Container Images
					- Containers images are lightweight, standalone and they include everything needed to run an
					application: code,
					runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
					- Container images become containers at runtime.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Why do we use Containers?
					- Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite
					differences for instance between development and staging.

					## Docker
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### What is Docker?
					- Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.
					- Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a container.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Docker Engine (CLI)
					- Docker Engine acts as a client-server application for building containers that can be accessed
					from the Terminal.
					- It has the following components:
					- dockerd: a server with a long-running daemon process.
					- APIs: specify interfaces that programs can use to talk to and instruct the Docker daemon.
					- docker: A command line interface (CLI) client.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Docker Destop (GUI)
					- Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
					- It includes the Docker Engine.
					- It is available for MacOS, Windows and Linux (deb package for Debian/Ubuntu and rpm package for
					Fedora/Red Hat).
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Docker Playground (Online)
					- You can also use the Docker Playground to learn Docker in an online environment.
					- You can also use you Terminal to ssh into the Playground VM.
					- URL: [ðŸ”— Docker Playground](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)

					## Docker Images
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### What is a Docker Image
					- An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.
					- It usually consists of a file system with files and packages necessary to run your applications.
					- Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization.
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### Example Recipe
					1. start with the Python3 image, install Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy (and other requirements)
					2. copy your source code files
					3. define a program to run (such as gunicorn or waitress web servers)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### ... From Images, To Containers
					- From there you are able to create containers from your image.
					- A container is a runnable instance of an image.
					- A container is defined by its image as well as any configuration options you provide to it when
					you create or start it.

					## Docker Hub
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					### What is Docker Hub?
					- Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images.
					- It is the worldâ€™s largest repository of container images.
					- You can create public repositories for free or choose a subscription plan for private
					repositories.
